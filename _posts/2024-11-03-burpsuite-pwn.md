# Burpsuite Pwn\n\n### **Hello, folks!**\n\nI’m a bug hunter, and, well, I was bored. My HackerOne profile was looking kinda sad with no fresh bounties, so I thought, "Why not do some noob research and see what happens?" So here we are. I went down the rabbit hole of Burp Suite extensions and stumbled upon something that could turn Burp into a full-blown attack vector. Buckle up—this one’s gonna be fun.\n\n...\n\n
