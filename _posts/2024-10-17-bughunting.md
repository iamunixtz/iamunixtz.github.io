## My Bug Hunting Journey: From Zero to Hero

![Banner](/assets/img/bughunting_index_image_0.jpg)

I started bug hunting back in **July 2023** on HackerOne. At first, I was just exploring, trying to understand how things work. My first valid report was marked as **informative**, but that didn't stop me. I kept learning.

### The First Win

It wasn't until **September 2024** that I found my first paid bounty. I discovered a **Blind SQL Injection** on a Department of Defense (DoD) platform.

Since then, I've earned over **$2,000** in bounties in just five months.
