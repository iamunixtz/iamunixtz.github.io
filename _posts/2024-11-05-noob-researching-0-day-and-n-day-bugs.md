When bug bounties get quiet, sometimes the best move is to step back and do some **noob research**—diving into 0-day and N-day territory, messing with tools we use every day, and seeing what breaks.

This section is where I document that kind of work: experiments with Burp Suite extensions, tool security, and the occasional "wait, can I pwn *this*?" moment.

**First writeup:** [Burpsuite Pwn](/posts/Burpsuite-Pwn/) — How malicious Burp extensions can turn the industry's favorite proxy into a full-blown attack vector (and why Burp said "working as intended").

More to come as I keep poking around. Stay curious.
