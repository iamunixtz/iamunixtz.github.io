# About

Hey there, fellow explorers of the digital abyss. I go by **Iamunixtz**, your friendly neighborhood bug hunter from Africa, still cruising under the age of 20s. This blog is my playground, my journal, and my confession booth—a space where I document my journey through the chaotic, thrilling world of hacking and cracking.

Let's get one thing straight: I'm not a certified cybersecurity guru. You can call me the **0certified kiddo**—no fancy papers, no official badges. But don't let that fool you. I've got a knack for sniffing out vulnerabilities and poking around places most wouldn't dare to touch. *(Just kidding… kinda.)*

I'm not here to flex. I'm here to learn, experiment, and share. Whether it's breaking down a vulnerable system, chasing elusive web bugs, or messing around with tools and techniques—this blog is my digital diary.

## What Fuels My Curiosity

I'm not just here to poke around websites—I'm diving deep into the guts of systems. My interests span across some of the most thrilling corners of cybersecurity:

- **API Hacking** — Dissecting APIs like a surgeon with a scalpel. Poor authentication, broken object-level authorization, sneaky data leaks—I'm always on the hunt.

- **Malware Development** — Not for evil, but for understanding. How malware operates, evades detection, and how defenders fight back. Building and breaking helps me learn.

- **Reverse Engineering** — Tearing binaries apart, tracing assembly, figuring out what makes software tick. It's like solving a puzzle where every piece fights back.

- **Bug Bounty Hunting** — This is my battlefield. I may not be perfect—not like those legendary APT groups—but I'm good at what I do. And I believe that one day, I'll be even better.

## My Learning Stack

I'm currently sharpening my skills in:

- **C** — The language of the gods. Low-level, powerful, and unforgiving—just the way I like it.

- **Python** — My go-to for scripting, automation, and quick exploits. Flexible and fast.

- **Assembly** — The raw truth. Learning this is like reading the Matrix—painful but enlightening.

I don't learn every day *(let's be real)*, but when I do, I go all in. No shortcuts, no fluff—just raw curiosity and a hunger to understand.

## Why This Blog?

Because hacking isn't just about breaking things—it's about understanding how they work. I want to document my learning curve, my wins, my fails, and everything in between. If you're just starting out, maybe my journey will help you dodge a few pitfalls. If you're a seasoned pro, maybe you'll find my rookie mistakes amusing. Either way, **Insha'Allah**, this space will be useful to someone out there.
